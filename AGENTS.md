# AI Agent advice for hklpy2

<https://agents.md>

## Purpose

Goal: Short guide for coding agents (auto-formatters, linters, CI bots, test runners, codegen agents) working on this Python project.

## Code Style

- Concise type annotations
- code location described in pyproject.toml
- style information described in pyproject.toml
- `pre-commit run --all-files`


## Agent pytest style (for automated agents) - MANDATORY

---

**CRITICAL: All test code MUST follow this pattern. Tests not following this pattern will be rejected.**

### Requirements

1. **ALWAYS use parametrized pytest** with `parms, context` as the parameter names
2. **ALWAYS use `pytest.param()`** for each parameter set with `id="..."`
3. **ALWAYS use context managers**: `does_not_raise()` for success, `pytest.raises(...)` for failures
4. **ALWAYS put all functional code and assertions inside `with context:` block**
5. **ALWAYS use `match=re.escape(...)` with `pytest.raises(...)`** for exception matching
6. **ALWAYS include failure test cases** - parameter sets that are expected to raise exceptions must use `pytest.raises(...)`
7. **NEVER create separate test functions** for success vs failure cases
8. **NEVER use try/except** for test logic
9. **NEVER use the deprecated `assert_context_result()` helper**

### Import requirements

```python
from contextlib import nullcontext as does_not_raise
import pytest
```

### Correct pattern (copy this exactly):

```py
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "parms, context",
    [
        pytest.param(
            dict(some_param=value1),
            does_not_raise(),
            id="description of test case 1",
        ),
        pytest.param(
            dict(some_param=invalid_value),
            pytest.raises(SomeError, match=re.escape("expected message")),
            id="description of test case 2",
        ),
    ],
)
def test_function_name(parms, context):
    with context:
        # ALL code that might raise goes HERE
        result = object_under_test.method(**parms)
        # ALL assertions go HERE (inside the with block)
        assert result.expected_attribute == some_value
```

### Common mistakes to avoid

- ❌ NOT this:
  ```py
  def test_something():
      # setup code...
      # test code...
  ```

- ❌ NOT this:
  ```py
  def test_success_case():
      # code...
      assert result == expected

  def test_failure_case():
      with pytest.raises(...):
          # code...
  ```

- ❌ NOT this:
  ```py
  @pytest.mark.parametrize(...)
  def test_something(values):
      try:
          result = do_something(values)
      except SomeError:
          # wrong!
  ```

- ✅ ALWAYS this:
  ```py
  @pytest.mark.parametrize(
      "parms, context",
      [
          pytest.param(dict(value=valid), does_not_raise(), id="valid case"),
          pytest.param(dict(value=invalid), pytest.raises(Error), id="error case"),
      ],
  )
  def test_something(parms, context):
      with context:
          result = do_something(**parms)
  ```

## Enforcement

PRs opened or modified by automated agents must follow the "Agent pytest style" described above. Reviewers and CI will check for this pattern (test parametrization and use of context managers for expected outcomes, both successful and failed). Changes from agents that do not comply may be requested for revision or reverted.

## Agent behavior rules

- Always follow the project's formatting, linting, and typing configs.
- Make minimal, focused changes; prefer separate commits per concern.
- Add or update tests for any behavioral change.
- Include clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
- If uncertain about design, open an issue instead of making large changes.
- Respect branch protection: push to feature branches and create PRs.

## Test style

- All test code for MODULE.py goes in file tests/test_MODULE.py
- tests should be written and organized using the project's test style guidelines.
- use parametrized pytests
- Prefer parameter sets that simulate user interactions
- all tests run code within context
- Store test code modules in submodule/tests/ directory
- maximize code coverage
- Use parametrized pytests
  - Generate additional parameters and sets to minimize the number of test functions.
  - Place all functional code in a parametrized context.
    - use parameter for does_not_raise() or pytest.raises(...) as fits the parameter set
      - `from contextlib import nullcontext as does_not_raise`
    - do not separate success and errors tests into different test functions
    - do not separate success and errors tests using try..except

## Inputs & outputs

- Inputs: file diffs, test results, config files, repository metadata
- Outputs: patch/commit, tests, updated docs, CI status

## Running locally

- Setup: create virtualenv, `pip install -e .[all]`
- Common commands:
  - Format & Lint: `make style` or `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - Test: `pytest ./hklpy2`

### pre-commit on NFS home directories

The pre-commit cache (`~/.cache/pre-commit`) lives on NFS on this system
(`aquila:/export/beams1`).  Setuptools' wheel-build cleanup uses `os.rmdir()`
which fails non-deterministically on NFS because directory-entry removals are
not immediately visible.  Symptom: `[Errno 39] Directory not empty` during
`pip install` for any pre-commit hook environment.

**Fix:** keep the pre-commit cache on local disk:

```bash
export PRE_COMMIT_HOME=/tmp/pre-commit-JEMIAN   # in ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile
```

This is already set in `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, and hardcoded in
`.git/hooks/pre-commit` (between the `# end templated` line and the `HERE=`
line).  If `pre-commit install` regenerates the hook, re-add that line:

```bash
# Use local disk for pre-commit cache (avoids NFS rmdir failures)
export PRE_COMMIT_HOME=/tmp/pre-commit-JEMIAN
```

The `Makefile` `pre` target also exports this variable automatically.

## CI integration

- Format and lint in pre-commit job
- Run tests and dependency audit on PRs.

## Minimal example PR checklist

- Runs formatting and linting locally
- Adds/updates tests for changes
- Includes changelog entry if behavior changed
- Marks PR as draft if large refactor

## Notes

- Keep agent actions small, reversible, and reviewable.
- When updating a file, verify that a change has actually been made by comparing
  the mtime before and after the edits.

## Code Coverage

- Aim for 100% coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over simply hitting every line.
